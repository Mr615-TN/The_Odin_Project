CSS is made up of various rules at the most basic level

<div> is an empty container

Selectors are HTML elements to which CSS rules apply (they are being selected for each rule)

Universial selectors will select elements of any type
    example -> { color:purple; }

A type selector will select all elements of the given element type (the syntax is just name of the element)
    example -> <div>Hello World!</div>


Class selectors will select all elements with the given class, which is just an attribute you place on an HTML element
    example -> <div class="alert-text">Please agree to our terms of service.</div>
                .alert-text {
                    color: red;
                }
ID selectors are similar to class selectors. They select an element with the given ID, which is another attribute you place on an HTML element. The major difference between classes and IDs is that an element can only have one ID.
    example -> <div id="title">My Awesome 90's Page</div>
                #title {
                background-color: red;
                }

Grouping selector:
    example -> .read {
                    color: white;
                    background-color: black;
                    /* several unique declarations */
                }

                .unread {
                    color: white;
                    background-color: black;
                    /* several unique declarations */
                }

    example ->  .read,
                .unread {
                    color: white;
                    background-color: black;
                }

                .read {
                    /* several unique declarations */
                }

                .unread {
                    /* several unique declarations */
                }
Chaining Selectors. Another way to use selectors is to chain them as a list without any separation.
    example ->  <div>
                    <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
                    <p class="subsection preview">This is where a preview for a post might go.</p>
                </div>
                .subsection.header {
                    color: red;
                }

    example ->  <div>
                    <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
                    <p class="subsection" id="preview">
                    This is where a preview for a post might go.
                    </p>
                </div>

                .subsection.header {
                    color: red;
                }

                .subsection#preview {
                    color: blue;
                }

There are four types of combinators in total, but for right now weâ€™re going to only show you the descendant combinator, which is represented in CSS by a single space between selectors. A descendant combinator will only cause elements that match the last selector to be selected if they also have an ancestor (parent, grandparent, etc.) that matches the previous selector.

    example:
        <div class="ancestor">
        <!-- A -->
        <div class="contents">
            <!-- B -->
            <div class="contents"><!-- C --></div>
        </div>
        </div>

        <div class="contents"><!-- D --></div>

        /* styles.css */

        .ancestor .contents {
        /* some declarations */
        }
