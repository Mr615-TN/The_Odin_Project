CSS is made up of various rules at the most basic level

<div> is an empty container

Selectors are HTML elements to which CSS rules apply (they are being selected for each rule)

Universial selectors will select elements of any type
    example -> { color:purple; }

A type selector will select all elements of the given element type (the syntax is just name of the element)
    example <div>Hello World!</div>
